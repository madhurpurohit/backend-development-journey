# MVC Pattern

The MVC pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality.

## Model

The Model represents the data of the application, handles business logic, and interacts with the database (e.g., CRUD operations).

## View

The View displays the data to the user and is responsible for rendering the presentation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) based on the data provided by the controller.

## Controller

The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user input, interacting with the Model to fetch/update data, and passing the data to the View for display.
