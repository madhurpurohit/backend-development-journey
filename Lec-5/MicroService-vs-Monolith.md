# WHat is Monolithic architecture?

Monolithic architecture is a software design where the entire application, including frontend, backend, and database logic, is built as a single unit. It is simple to develop and deploy but becomes difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows. Unlike microservices, monolithic applications require the entire system to be redeployed even for small changes, making them less flexible for large-scale applications.

## Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

✅ Easier to Develop & Debug – Since everything is in one place, it’s simpler to build and test.

✅ Faster Initial Development – Good for small projects and startups.

✅ Easier Deployment – Only one codebase to manage.

✅ Better Performance – No network latency between services since everything runs in one application.

## Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

❌ Hard to Scale – If one feature needs more resources, the entire app must scale.

❌ Slow Deployment – Even small changes require redeploying the whole application.

❌ Difficult Maintenance – As the app grows, the codebase becomes complex.

❌ Less Flexibility – Cannot use different technologies for different services.

# What is Microservice architecture?

Microservices architecture is a software design where an application is broken into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs. Each service focuses on a specific functionality, making it easier to scale, deploy, and maintain. Unlike monolithic architecture, microservices allow for technology flexibility and fault isolation, but they require more infrastructure and come with added complexity.

## Advantages of Microservices Architecture

✅ Scalability – You can scale individual services independently.

✅ Faster Deployment – Small changes don’t require redeploying the entire application.

✅ Easier Maintenance – Smaller codebases are easier to manage.

✅ Technology Flexibility – Different services can use different programming languages and databases.

✅ Fault Isolation – A failure in one service does not crash the whole system.

## 4️⃣ Disadvantages of Microservices Architecture

❌ Complex Development – Managing multiple services increases complexity.

❌ More Infrastructure Needed – Requires API gateways, load balancers, and service discovery.

❌ Network Latency – Services communicate over the network, which may slow response times.

❌ Data Management Challenges – Each service may have its own database, making consistency harder to manage.
